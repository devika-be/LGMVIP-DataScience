## Task-1 : Stock-Price-Prediction-And-Forecasting-Using-Stacked-LSTM

Here in this project I have analysed the dataset of Stock Market Prediction And Forecasting where all the details are being provided Exploratory Data Analysis - Stock Market.

(Level - Basic)

The dataset is taken from AAPL company which is given in the task. In this model I used the Stacked LSTM(Long Short Term Memory). A Machine Learning Model for Stock Market Prediction. Stock market prediction is the act of trying to determine the future value of a company stock or other financial instrument traded on a financial exchange.


## Task-2 : Exploratory-Data-Analysis-Terrorism

Here in this project I have analysed the huge dataset of Terrorism where all the details are being provided Exploratory Data Analysis - Terrorism.

(Level - Intermediate)

● Perform ‘Exploratory Data Analysis’ on dataset ‘Global Terrorism’

● As a security/defense analyst, try to find out the hot zone of terrorism.

● You can choose any of the tool of your choice

## Task-3 : Prediction-using-Decision-Tree-Algorithm

Here in this project I have analysed the Iris dataset where all the details are being provided Prediction using Decision Tree Algorithm.

Created the Decision Tree classifier and visualized it graphically. The purpose is if we feed any new data to this classifier, it would be able to predict the right class accordingly.
