## Task-1 : Stock-Price-Prediction-And-Forecasting-Using-Stacked-LSTM

Here in this project I have analysed the dataset of Stock Market Prediction And Forecasting where all the details are being provided Exploratory Data Analysis - Stock Market.

(Level - Basic)

The dataset is taken from AAPL company which is given in the task. In this model I used the Stacked LSTM(Long Short Term Memory). A Machine Learning Model for Stock Market Prediction. Stock market prediction is the act of trying to determine the future value of a company stock or other financial instrument traded on a financial exchange.
